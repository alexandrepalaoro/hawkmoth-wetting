## Wettability and capillary pressure differential of the proboscis of hawkmoths

This repository contain the raw data and codes for the manuscript on wettability and capillary pressure differentials of hawkmoths.

The data folder contain all the data we used to generate the figures and statitics in the paper:

1- Files in .xlsx extension contain the observations per individual of the species. In the case of the radii calculations, we only measured one individual per species.

2- Files in .csv were used with the R codes. 
<br><i>2.1</i> - The "<i>ca-slopes.csv</i>" was used to calculate the slopes of change of contact angle along the proboscis.
<br><i>2.2</i> - The "<i>avgs.csv</i>" contain the averages for the species. All averages can be found in the xlsx files, and the exact description of how we calculated the averages is described in the paper.
